Creating Milestones:

Milestone Title: T-Shirt Customization Module Completion

Description: This milestone focuses on completing the T-shirt customization module, allowing users to upload, apply, and remove designs seamlessly. This includes frontend design, backend integration, and testing to ensure a smooth user experience.

Due Date: December 15, 2024

Significance: This milestone is critical because it delivers the core functionality of the project. Achieving it will bring the platform closer to being fully operational and provide users with a unique customization feature.
Managing Issues:

1. Bug Report:

Title: Design Preview Not Updating

Description: When users apply a design to the T-shirt, the preview does not update immediately. This bug affects user experience and needs immediate attention.

Assigned To: Rahul

Labels: Bug, High Priority

2. Feature Request:

Title: Add Save Design Functionality

Description: Implement a feature that allows users to save their customized T-shirt designs for future purchases or edits.

Assigned To: Priya

Labels: Enhancement, Feature Request

3. Task:

Title: Create Database for User Designs

Description: Set up a MySQL database table to store user-uploaded designs and their customization data.

Assigned To: Mehul

Labels: Task, Backend
Using Project Boards:

We will set up a GitHub project board with the following columns:

To Do: Contains all the tasks, bugs, and feature requests yet to start.

In Progress: For tasks currently being worked on.

Done: Completed tasks that are ready for review or have passed testing.

Initially, we will add five issues to the "To Do" column:

Design Preview Not Updating

Add Save Design Functionality

Create Database for User Designs

Frontend Design for T-Shirt Customization

Integrate Design Upload Functionality

This board will help track the project's progress by clearly showing what’s pending, in progress, or completed. Team members can move issues between
columns as they work on them, ensuring transparency and better collaboration.

Linking Issues to Milestones:

Linked Issues:

Add Save Design Functionality

Create Database for User Designs

Reasoning: These issues are directly related to the milestone as they are essential features for completing the T-shirt customization module. Without the ability to save designs and store them in a database, the module’s functionality would be incomplete.
Reflection on Project Management Tools:

Using GitHub’s project management features, like milestones, issues, and project boards, can significantly improve team collaboration and organization. Milestones provide a clear goal for the team to work toward, ensuring everyone understands the project’s priorities and deadlines. Issues allow the team to document specific tasks, bugs, or features in a structured way, making it easier to assign work and track progress. Project boards give a visual representation of the workflow, showing what needs to be done and what’s already completed.

One challenge we might face is ensuring team members consistently update the board and issues. If updates are neglected, it could lead to confusion or duplicate efforts. Another challenge is accurately estimating the time required for each task, as delays might affect milestone deadlines. To address these, we’ll hold regular check-ins and encourage open communication to keep everyone aligned. Despite these challenges, these tools will help us work more efficiently and deliver a polished project.
